# chronic_holder
Files and instructions for manufacturing NP1.0, NP2.0alpha, and NP2.0 Neuropixels chronic recording cases.

(Add table of contents?)

## Tools list
The following lab tools are required to assemble and implant a probe holder.

- solder station
- forceps (for probe handling)
- small phillips screwdriver
- hex key (TODO: add size)
- putty to hold probes when not in use (link)
- Kopf surgical stereotax (we will soon make stereotax arm attachments for other manufactures) TODO: more stereotax details?
- Standard rodent surgical tool set
- Thorlabs posts and connectors are helpful for washing probes, but using the sterotax is also fine if not needed for other surgeries
- The Imec acute recording post (the one that's meant to go with the dovetail) is also helpful for washing the probes
-

If 3D printing parts in-house:
- Formlabs Form 3+ printer
- Form Wash
- Form Cure
- Resin Tank
- Grey Pro resin
- Isopropanol



## Parts list (non-printed)
The following parts are required to assemble and implante one probe holder. (requirements are the same for all probe versions).
- 1x Neuropixels 1.0/2.0/2.0alpha probe (with metal cap. Metal caps (dovetails) can also be glued on in house, but alignment may not be as good.)
- 1x set screw (TODO: M1x3 or M1x4?)
- 1x nut (TODO: details for stereotax nut)
- 1x bolt (TODO: details for stereotax stereotax bolt)
- silver wire (TODO: link)
- Kapton tape (thin, for soldering ground wire)
-

## Manufacturing
Parts should be printed on a FormLabs resin printer with Grey Pro resin. We have found this resin to have the best material properties for chronic recordings. Other brands may work but are untested.
